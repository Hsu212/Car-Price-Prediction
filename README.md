## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model aims to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type. The project utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Load and preprocess car data from a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the dataset to understand trends and relationships between features.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables for model training.
- **Model Training**: Implement various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, to predict car prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hsu212/Car-Price-Prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Place the `car data.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook. You can download a sample dataset or use your own.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Execute the Cells**:
   Run each cell in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Adjust parameters as necessary to improve predictions.
